Skypieans train their hair to grow like the antenna of an insect from a young age. Their wing style is very different from Birkans, styled closer to the Shandia wings. Their wings tend to have shorter feathers that are slightly less in number than a Shandia, often these feathers are thicker and more rounded. They are so close that at times the wings appear to be identical. However, the main difference between Shandia and Skypieans is that Skypieans often have lighter skin tones. They wear more simple civilian looking attire than the Shandia and Birkans.
The people who reside there have small wings on their backs, similar to the stereotypical angel which make them really unique, though no use has been revealed for them thus far. The daily life of sky people revolves around the use of Dials, which normally are not available in the Blue Sea. As opposed to the belly of the rest of the world, it uses extols as currency. The people of Skypiea have a religious reverence for soil, because it can yield plant life much better than island cloud can, and also other materials that come from the Blue Sea. Most of the people from the Blue Sea believe that Skypiea is merely a myth. The currency used in Skypiea is Extol and 10,000 Extol is worth Beli.png1.
Under Enel's Rule
Six years ago, Enel came to Skypiea with his men, after destroying his homeland Birka. He overthrew Gan Fall, claimed his position as God and became the despotic ruler of Skypiea himself. He settled in Upper Yard with his warriors and servants, but for Skypieans and all other people this island became a forbidden land on death penalty.

After Enel took over, all the citizens of Skypiea lived in constant fear of him. His highly developed mantra and ability to sense electric fields allowed him to hear conversations and thus made him aware of almost everything happening in Skypiea. If anyone dared to speak out against Enel or challenge his list of commandments, he would shoot a giant column of lightning down from the sky to effectively eliminate the dissenter. Enel made foreigners out to be criminals by imputing a crime for almost any of their actions (even snoring). Until they arrived for the Judgment, the inhabitants of Skypiea were responsible for guiding them there. Anyone would become criminal themselves upon helping a criminal. This gave birth to the citizens' sense of crime and they became feeble and weak.[13]

The inhabitants of this haven 10,000 meters above the ground are a kind, trusting folk naturally, although through the years the war with Shandia, the thievery of blue-sea dwellers and the harsh rule of gods has jaded them, leaving them with a bitter taste towards outsiders in general. This isolationism is in stark contrast to Fish-Man Island, 10,000 meters below the waves, who, while sharing the traits of kindness, had become largely swamped with outsiders.
The Heaven's Gate (天国の門 Tengoku no Mon?) is located in the White Sea and serves as an entrance to Skypiea. Visitors must pay 1,000,000,000 Extol per person to enter. Amazon, the gate-keeper that resides down here with her Vision Dial-powered camera, collects entrance immigration fees, and immigration for those who are leaving. She is generally unable to understand the events around her, as she lets people in without collecting fees, but not warning them they will become criminals. When everyone was evacuating Angel Island, she attempted to take images of them all, not realizing that Angel Island was about to be destroyed. Many outsiders become criminals for not paying the fee, because Amazon fails to explain Extol.

After going past Amazon, a giant Speedy Shrimp will grasp the immigrant's ship and lift it along a Milky Road, which goes up to the White-White Sea. Finally the guests will arrive in Skypiea. The Heaven's Gate was destroyed along with Angel Island by Enel's Raigo attack though Amazon was able to escape.
Gan Fall's Home

Gan Fall's House.

After being ousted by Enel, Gan Fall began living in this humble cabin positioned on the very outskirts of Skypiea, which is well beyond the range of Enel's mantra. It is surrounded by much flora, including an oversized tree and a vegetable garden to raise his beloved pumpkins in.[6]

After Conis and Pagaya implicated themselves by warning the Straw Hat Pirates of Enel's machinations, Gan Fall flew the pair here for protection. However, it would not be long before all three left - Gan Fall to answer a distress call from Tony Tony Chopper, and Conis and Pagaya in a general resolution to help the Straw Hats escape Skypiea.[7][8]

It is unknown whether this cabin survived Enel's Deathpiea assault, or if Gan Fall ever returned to it after being restored to his prior title.
Skypieans[citation needed] are the people who come from Skypiea and live on Angel Island and other islands in the sky. The term "Skypiean" came from English dubs, and is not in the original Japanese, where the race was simply called Sky People (空の者 Sora no mono?).[citation needed] They first appeared in Chapter 238 and Episode 153.

The Skypieans are mostly a non-aggressive race who live peacefully on the Sky Islands. They use dials for everyday use, such as cooking. They have small wings similar to the ones found on the backs of the Shandia. They greet each other by saying 'Heso' (which is Japanese for bellybutton) often while putting their hand against their head and sticking two fingers up.
